What is this?
------
This is a coding challenge I completed using C# in Visual Studio, the challenge went as follows:  
* Write a program that takes as input the dimensions of a room and outputs the following:
 * Area of the floor
 * Amount of paint required to paint the walls
 * Volume of the room

How do I use it?
------
You can simply use the program by going into the `BUILT PROGRAM` folder, this has a compiled version of the program ready to run in it, just click "Challenge.exe".

How do I view the source code?
------
You can view the source code by going to the `Challenge` folder and opening the `Form1.cs` file. This contains all of the code that is used in the program.  
You can also open the `Challenge.sln` project file in Visual Studio in order to see the form in action along-side the code.

How can I re-build/compile the program?
------
If you have edited the program in Visual Studio, you can re-build it to the `Challenge\bin\Debug` folder by clicking on `Build` in the menu and hitting the `Build Challenge` button.  
Alternatively you can press `Shift + F6` to build the project.
